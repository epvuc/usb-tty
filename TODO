softuart_kbhit() returns TRUE once per character time when in break condition, and
returns a null. Normally you don't see this since its a null which doesn't produce
output when translated, but if you have a null or different translation table, it
shows as a constant stream of characters. Unclear what the right action is but this
is probably not it. 

Ideally it would be best to fix the interrupt softuart receive section to distinguish
between a correctly framed character with all zero bits, and a break which doesn't
have correct framing. This is hard and I'm not going to get it done before shipping.
Also, nobody will care. 

Implement some sort of auto-print-message thing to dump a block of text from eeprom
to the tty loop. --- this is done 5/1/2016. it's halfassed and only allows 512 bytes
because it goes in the second half of eeprom on the 32u2. If you turn on autoprint
mode and have a message stored, it will print the message when it receives a break
on the loop. This also seems like a bad idea.


Still no idea if 8 bit mode is usable with a real model 33. 

Figure out if I should leave the stock Atmel DFU bootloader or install the LUFA one.
LUFA is better because of the LED and because it can be reinstalled, but if it doesn't 
work with FLIP in windows, I can't use it. ( It does, so use Atmel one, because you
can't change fuse without erasing the builtin one, and you can't use the crystal 
without changing fuses) 
LUFA DFU bootloader seems entirely fine.

On linux at least, if you connect USB, then press the button before ever opening the
CDC device from the host, it will hang such that you have to power cycle.


If you have autoprint mode enabled and power up with the adapter not connected to
the loop, it will autoprint as soon as you plug it in. There's no way around this
because not being connected to the loop is... a break. This may be a feature, not
a bug.
