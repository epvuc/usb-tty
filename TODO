softuart_kbhit() returns TRUE once per character time when in break condition, and
returns a null. Normally you don't see this since its a null which doesn't produce
output when translated, but if you have a null or different translation table, it
shows as a constant stream of characters. Unclear what the right action is but this
is probably not it. 

Ideally it would be best to fix the interrupt softuart receive section to distinguish
between a correctly framed character with all zero bits, and a break which doesn't
have correct framing. 




Implement some sort of auto-print-message thing to dump a block of text from eeprom
to the tty loop. Need to decide how to trigger it though - 
if by the onboard button, how do we ever get back to conf mode? 
If by detecting a loop break, I have to write code to measure duration of break and
be selective about how long of a break to consider a print trigger.
If by typed character, people with keyboardless machines can't use it. 
Maybe have a separate mode enabled by powering on with the button held down? 
I hate having so many modes though. 



Still no idea if 8 bit mode is usable with a real model 33.
